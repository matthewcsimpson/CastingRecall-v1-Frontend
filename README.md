## Casting Recall - A Movie Guessing Game

Can you guess the movie based on the cast? That's the hook of _Casting ReCall_. The game presents you with six cast lineups, and you have ten guesses to get them all!

This game was built using `React.js`, with `JavaScript`, `HTML`, `SCSS`, `React Router`, and `Axios` and is currently deployed at <https://castingrecall.herokuapp.com>
